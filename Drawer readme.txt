Note that file 'Drawer Foam Insert Outline' is designed to be laser cut as is. It has a built in 0.5mm outline tolerance in the design file. This change can be reverted from the end user, or you can use the 'Drawer Full included for reference only' file but note that the number of geometries on the bottom of the drawer make this file more cluttered. Also note that the first file 'Drawer Foam Insert Outline' has been tested on two sizes of drawers and three individual sets (both the 3 drawer config and the 2 drawer congif)
